# Airgead-Banking
# Banking App, Deposit and Investment amounts

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   The client requested a banking app to show the end user the deposit amounts and the investment gained with or without additional deposits
2. What did you do particularly well?
   Executing the data by using for loops once I figured it out, and making the code to run without errors that I could see.
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   My main issue is commenting and keeping the code readable as much as possible.
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   Within the for loops and allowing the code to run effectively. The calculation portion was difficult until I was able to search for a solution online for examples of investment    calculators.
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   Being able to create a foundation for an app, and having the opportunity to grow as I learn more on the best practices and methods.
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   I did my best to keep the code as easy as possible and maintainable. A minor change shouldn't effect how the code is effected and should be able to add more to the code and        provide more information or options for the end user.
